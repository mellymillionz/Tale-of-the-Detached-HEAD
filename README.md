# Tale-of-the-Detached-HEAD

## A spooky exercise in version control

The morning Ichabod Crane arrived in Sleepy Hollow was foggy and cold. The town's data scientists and software engineers, usually the coolest members of the town, spoke in frightening hushed tones. A murder had occured in the wee hours of the morning, and several townspeople had witnessed a gruesome scene: a figure with a missing HEAD galloping through the streets at the time the murder had occurred. He was last seen at a fork in the road, taking the left branch across the murky river...

Ichabod Crane was a master detective, handsome as a Hollywood celebrity and beloved by all the townspeople. He had the most fantastic bespoke Victorian technology that, in the hands of such an expert, could catch the most elusive of criminals. Following a grand parade honoring his arrival, he got to work.
